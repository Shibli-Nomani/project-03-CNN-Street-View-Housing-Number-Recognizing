# ⛺ Context

Recognizing things in their natural settings is one of the most fascinating challenges in the field of deep learning. The capacity to analyze visual information using machine learning algorithms may be highly valuable, as shown by a variety of applications. The SVHN dataset includes approximately 600,000 digits that have been identified and were clipped from street-level photographs. It is one of the image recognition datasets that is used the most often. It has been put to use in the neural networks that Google has developed in order to enhance the quality of maps by automatically trancribing address numbers from individual pixel clusters. The combination of the transcribed number and the known street address makes it easier to locate the building that the number represents.

# 🔨 About Custom Model
**🧠 Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model**
This custom CNN model uses multiple convolutional layers (Conv2D) with activation functions like ReLU and LeakyReLU. It includes batch normalization, pooling layers (AveragePooling2D), and dropout for regularization. The model ends with dense layers and a softmax output layer for multi-class classification.

# 🎢 Summary 
We have created customized model for the Recognizing Street View Housing Number over Gray Image using the SVHN_single_grey1.h5 file. Model accuracy is 95.248% for training and 93.794% for testing.

By working on with layers/normalization/ image Data Genaration, we can improve the accuracy and drop down the loss.
